# Add One News Link to the Bottom of `index.html` (GitHub → Netlify Auto Update)

Goal: Make **one news link** appear at the **bottom of your main page** (`index.html`).
Result: After commit, **Netlify auto-deploys** and the link appears on your site.

---

## 0) Before You Start (What You Need)
- You already have:
  - A GitHub repository connected to Netlify
  - A working Netlify URL (site is deployed)

You will edit **one file**:
- `index.html` (main page)

---

## 1) Open the Repository on GitHub
1. Go to GitHub and open your repository (example name: `jb-bank-philippines-desk`).
2. In the file list, click **`index.html`**.

---

## 2) Enter Edit Mode
1. On the `index.html` page, click the **pencil icon (Edit)**.
2. You are now editing the file in the browser.

---

## 3) Find the Bottom of the File
1. Scroll to the very bottom.
2. Look for these lines near the end:

```html
</body>
</html>
✅ Important rule:

You must paste the new code above </body> (not below it).

4) Paste This News Link Block (Exact Copy/Paste)
Click your cursor right above this line:

html
코드 복사
</body>
Paste the following block exactly:

html
코드 복사
<hr>

<p><strong>Latest News</strong></p>

<p>
  <a href="/news/korea-accepts-80000-e9/">
    Korea accepts 80,000 E-9 workers in 2026
  </a>
</p>
5) Save by Committing the Change
Scroll down to the Commit changes section.

Do NOT change anything unless you want to.

Keep the default commit message (recommended).

Click the green Commit changes button.

✅ At this moment, the change is saved in GitHub.

6) Confirm Netlify Auto Deployment
Open Netlify dashboard.

Click your site.

Check Deploys tab:

You should see a new deploy triggered by the commit.

Wait until status becomes:

Published

✅ This means your change is live.

7) Verify on the Website
Open your main page:

https://jb-bank-philippines.netlify.app/ (or your current domain)

Scroll to the bottom.

You should see:

"Latest News"

A clickable link:

"Korea accepts 80,000 E-9 workers in 2026"

Click the link:

It should open:

https:/hwphilippines.netlify.app/news/korea-accepts-80000-e9/

8) If It Does Not Work (Fast Checks)
A) Link goes to 404 / Not Found
Confirm the target page exists:

Visit directly:

/news/korea-accepts-80000-e9/

If it does not open, the article folder/page is missing or not deployed.

B) Nothing appears on the main page
You may have pasted the block:

Below </body> (wrong)

Inside a different section that is hidden

Fix:

Move the pasted block to just above </body>.

C) Netlify does not update
Check if commit really happened:

GitHub file shows latest update time

Check Netlify deploy:

Deploys tab shows new deploy triggered

9) Add More News Links Later (Same Pattern)
To add another link, just copy one more <p>...</p> block:

html
코드 복사
<p>
  <a href="/news/ANOTHER-SLUG/">
    Another news title here
  </a>
</p>
Paste it under the first one, then commit again.

Done ✅
You now have a simple, stable way to show at least one news link on the main page without building an automated index system.
