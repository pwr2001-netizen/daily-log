## ✅ Final Solution (Practical & Stable for Debian + XFCE)

### Background
On Debian + XFCE, fcitx5 often starts correctly at boot, but the input method
remains inactive (dormant). As a result, Korean input does not work immediately
after login, even though the fcitx5 daemon is already running.

Manually opening `fcitx5-configtool` wakes up the input method and makes Korean
input work, which proves that the problem is NOT installation or configuration,
but a missing activation trigger during startup.

The solution is to:
1) Explicitly start fcitx5 at login
2) Force it to wake up once after the desktop session is ready

---

### 1️⃣ Register fcitx5 in Startup Programs

This ensures the fcitx5 daemon is always running after login.

XFCE Menu  
Settings → Session and Startup → Application Autostart → Add

Command:
fcitx5 -d --replace

Name: Fcitx5  
Description: Input Method

Effect:
- Starts the fcitx5 daemon reliably at every login
- Prevents missing or duplicated fcitx5 instances

---

### 2️⃣ Add a Wake-Up Trigger (Critical Step)

This step is essential. Without it, fcitx5 may remain in a dormant state.

Add one more startup entry in the same menu:

Command:
sh -c "sleep 1 && fcitx5 -r"

Name: Fcitx5 Wakeup  

Purpose:
- Waits 1 second to allow the XFCE session and system tray to initialize
- Forces fcitx5 to reload and activate the input method state
- Has the same effect as manually opening the configuration tool
- Eliminates the need for any manual interaction after boot

---

### Result

After applying both startup entries:
- Korean input works immediately after boot
- No need to open fcitx5-configtool manually
- Stable behavior across terminal, browser, and LibreOffice
- Reboot-safe and update-safe

This approach resolves almost all Korean input issues caused by
fcitx5 activation timing on Debian + XFCE.

---

### Final Verdict

This is the most practical, stable, and real-world solution
for Korean input on Debian + XFCE.
