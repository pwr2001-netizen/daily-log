## 2. Structural Problems of LibreCAD on Windows

This section explains **why Windows LibreCAD often fails in real work**.

---

### ❌ 1. Command Line / Docking Problems

**Symptoms**
- Command Line disappears
- Enabled in View menu but not visible
- Not listed under Toolbars
- No reliable way to restore

**Root Cause**
- Qt Dock state corruption
- Especially frequent in Windows MSVC builds
- Triggered by DPI scaling or display changes

➡ **This is not a user mistake**

---

### ❌ 2. No UI Reset in Windows Builds

- Some Linux builds include UI reset
- **Windows MSVC builds do not**
- `Options → Restore Defaults` is missing

➡ Only solution: manually delete config files  
➡ Extremely unfriendly for non-technical users

---

### ❌ 3. DWG Handling Limitations

- LibreCAD is **DXF-oriented**
- DWG is opened via conversion
- Block / dimension / attribute structures are not preserved

➡ **Not a DWG-compatible editor**
➡ DWG is for reference only

---

### ❌ 4. Maintenance & Direction Issues

- Slow development pace
- Limited Windows QA testing
- Linux-first, Windows-second priority

➡ Not suitable for production environments

---

### ❌ 5. Misalignment with Professional Responsibility

- UI failure = work stoppage
- Cause unclear
- Requires reinstall or manual cleanup

➡ **High risk when money and deadlines are involved**

---

## 3. Realistic Position of LibreCAD

| Usage | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| Learning | ✅ |
| Personal practice | ✅ |
| Linux environment | ⚠️ |
| Windows professional use | ❌ |
| Delivery / collaboration | ❌ |

---

## Key Conclusion (One Sentence)

> **LibreCAD is an open-source 2D CAD tool,  
not a professional Windows CAD solution.**

The problems encountered are **tool limitations, not skill issues**.

---

## Practical Recommendations

- LibreCAD (Windows): ❌ Avoid
- QCAD Community Edition: ✅ Simple edits / reference
- AutoCAD / BricsCAD: ✅ Collaboration & delivery
- LibreCAD on Linux: Learning / experimentation only

This marks the transition from  
**“Why doesn’t this work?”**  
to  
**“Which tool fits which job?”**
