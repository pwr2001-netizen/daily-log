#  (Linux / X11)

## Problem Overview
On a Linux system using **X11** and **fcitx5**, Hangul (Korean) input was not working even though:
- The input method icon showed Korean selected
- The Hangul/English toggle key worked
- Environment variables (`XMODIFIERS`, `GTK_IM_MODULE`, `QT_IM_MODULE`) were correctly set

However, **actual Hangul composition did not occur** in any application (including Firefox and ChatGPT).

---

## Key Symptoms
- Switching input mode worked visually, but typing produced only Latin characters
- `fcitx5-remote -n` returned:
keyboard-kr

yaml

- This indicated that only a **Korean keyboard layout** was active, **not the Hangul IME engine**

---

## Root Cause (Confirmed)
> **The Hangul IME engine was not selected as the active input method.**

- `keyboard-kr` = keyboard layout only (no Hangul composition)
- `Hangul` = actual Hangul input engine (required for Korean syllable composition)

Even though `fcitx5-hangul` was installed, it was **not active**.

## Verification Commands
```bash
fcitx5-remote -n
Incorrect state:

코드 복사
keyboard-kr
Correct state:

nginx
코드 복사
Hangul
Resolution Steps
1. Ensure Hangul IME Package Is Installed
bash
코드 복사
sudo apt install fcitx5-hangul
(Already installed in this case.)

2. Open Fcitx5 Configuration Tool
bash
코드 복사
fcitx5-configtool
3. Fix Input Method Configuration
In Input Method tab:

Remove:

Keyboard - Korean

keyboard-kr

Click Add

Search for Hangul or Korean (Hangul)

Add it

Move Hangul to the top of the list

4. Confirm Active Input Method
bash
코드 복사
fcitx5-remote -n
Expected output:

nginx
코드 복사
Hangul
Result
Hangul input started working immediately

Korean syllable composition functioned correctly across applications

No browser-, Wayland-, or environment-variable issues remained

The issue resolved once the Hangul IME engine properly attached.

Important Notes
hangul is not a shell command
(bash: hangul: command not found is expected and normal)

This was not a browser bug

This was not an X11 or Wayland issue

This was not an environment variable issue

One-Line Summary
The Hangul IME was installed but not selected; switching from keyboard-kr to Hangul fixed the issue instantly.

Quick Recovery Tip (If It Happens Again)
bash
코드 복사
fcitx5 -r
Then check:

bash
코드 복사
fcitx5-remote -n
Ensure it says:

nginx
코드 복사
Hangul
