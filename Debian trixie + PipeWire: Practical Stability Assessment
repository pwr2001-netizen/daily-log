# ❌ Debian trixie + PipeWire: Practical Stability Assessment

## Summary Conclusion

In the current environment, **the Debian trixie + PipeWire combination is not sufficiently stable for practical, daily desktop use**.

Despite multiple recovery attempts:

- `wireplumber` is running,
- but `pipewire-pulse` (PulseAudio compatibility layer) fails to bind correctly,
- resulting in `pactl` timeouts, silent browsers, and cascading session-level issues,
- even after reinstallations, socket resets, and reboots.

This is **not a user configuration mistake**,  
but a **real-world compatibility issue** observed with:

> **Debian trixie (development branch) + XFCE + PipeWire**

---

## Current State Diagnosis

- ✔ `wireplumber`: active (running)
- ⚠ `pipewire`: socket-based idle state
- ❌ `pipewire-pulse`: Pulse server not reachable → `pactl` connection timeout
- ❌ Browser audio not working
- ❌ Input method (fcitx5) intermittently affected

👉 Structurally “alive but not functional”

---

## Practical Recommendation

> **For a work-oriented desktop, there is no strong reason to insist on PipeWire here.**

While PipeWire is a modern multimedia stack, in this setup:

- Debian *trixie* (unstable / development)
- XFCE desktop
- Typical desktop workloads (browser, office, coding)

the **stability risk outweighs the benefits**.

## Available Options

### 🔵 Option 1 — Log out and test once more
- Clears a potentially corrupted login session
- If successful, PipeWire can be kept
- If not, proceed to Option 2

### 🟢 Option 2 — Switch to PulseAudio only (**Recommended**)
- Completely remove PipeWire and wireplumber
- Use PulseAudio as the sole audio system
- Long-term proven stability with XFCE
- Immediate recovery of browser audio, `pactl`, `pavucontrol`, and input methods

👉 **For a work desktop, Option 2 is the correct choice**

---

## Final Decision Required

Please choose **one** of the following:

- **“Log out and test once more”**
- **“Switch directly to PulseAudio”**

Based on your choice, the next step will  
**complete the setup in a single, final procedure**.
