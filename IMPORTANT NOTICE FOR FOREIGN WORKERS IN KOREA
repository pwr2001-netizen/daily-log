📢 IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR FOREIGN WORKERS IN KOREA

This wage arrears support policy is a system designed to support foreign workers who are currently detained in Immigration Protection Centers.
Labor inspectors directly visit these facilities to provide counseling, conduct investigations, and assist with wage recovery.

In simple terms:

Even foreign workers who are in immigration detention during deportation procedures have the right to receive wages for work they performed in Korea, and the Korean government will directly assist them to ensure those wages are paid.

✔ Immigration status does NOT cancel your right to unpaid wages
✔ Government labor inspectors visit detention facilities in person
✔ Wage claims are handled before deportation procedures
✔ Interpretation support is available

💬 If you worked in Korea and were not paid properly,
your wages are protected by law — even if you are currently in an Immigration Protection Center.
