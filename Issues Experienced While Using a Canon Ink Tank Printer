## 2. Reasons for Switching to a Brother Ink Tank Printer (Personal User Perspective)

- Ink (or toner) warnings are generally displayed as informational messages
- Printing is usually still possible even when warning messages are shown
- Consumable warnings do not immediately lead to output being blocked
- Firmware updates are optional and not automatically enforced
- Core printing functionality remains available even without applying updates
- When settings remain unchanged, printing behavior tends to stay consistent over long periods of time
