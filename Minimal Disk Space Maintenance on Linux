# Minimal Disk Space Maintenance on Linux  
*(Debian / XFCE – What You Actually Need to Do)*

## Overview

Unlike Windows, Linux systems do **not** require regular “disk cleaning”
to maintain performance.

However, there are **a few minimal and safe actions**
that can be performed **occasionally** to reclaim disk space,
especially on long-running systems.

This document lists **only what is necessary** —
nothing more.

---

## 1. APT Package Cache Cleanup (Optional, Safe)

APT stores downloaded `.deb` packages in a local cache.
These files are **not automatically deleted**, but they are also **harmless**.

### When to do this
- Disk space is running low
- System has been updated many times
- Once every few months (at most)

### Command
```bash
sudo apt clean
What it does
Removes cached package files from:

swift
코드 복사
/var/cache/apt/archives/
Does not remove installed software

Does not affect system stability

Frequency
Rarely

Only when disk space matters

2. Remove Unused Automatically Installed Packages
Some libraries are installed automatically as dependencies
and may no longer be needed after software removal.

Command
bash
코드 복사
sudo apt autoremove
What it does
Removes unused dependency packages

Keeps explicitly installed software intact

Safe and recommended

When to run
After uninstalling software

Occasionally as general maintenance

3. System Logs (Usually Not Required)
On modern Debian systems (systemd-based),
log files are automatically rotated and size-limited.

Check current log usage (optional)
bash
코드 복사
journalctl --disk-usage
Reduce logs only if necessary
bash
코드 복사
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
Important
Default behavior is already safe

Manual log cleanup is not required for normal use

4. Things You Should NOT Do
The following actions are unnecessary or harmful on Linux:

❌ Installing “Linux cleaner” tools

❌ Manually deleting files in /tmp

❌ Forcing RAM or cache cleanup

❌ Deleting system directories

❌ Running scripts that “optimize” disk usage aggressively

Linux is designed to manage temporary files and caches automatically.

5. Summary (Minimal Maintenance Philosophy)
Action	Required
Regular disk cleaning	❌ No
RAM/cache flushing	❌ No
APT cache cleanup	⚠️ Rarely
Autoremove unused packages	✅ Occasionally
Log cleanup	❌ Usually unnecessary

Final Conclusion
Linux does not accumulate “junk files” in the way Windows does.
Disk space maintenance should be minimal, intentional, and rare.

If the system is running normally and disk space is sufficient,
no action is required.
