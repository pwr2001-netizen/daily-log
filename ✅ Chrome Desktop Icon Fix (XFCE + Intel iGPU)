# ✅ Chrome Desktop Icon Fix (XFCE + Intel iGPU)

## Summary

This document records the **successful setup of a desktop icon on XFCE**  
that launches Google Chrome with **stable streaming settings**,  
solving the issue where:

- Chrome works correctly when launched from the terminal
- ❌ But fails or freezes when launched from a desktop icon

The final solution ensures that **desktop icon execution behaves exactly the same as terminal execution**.

---

## 🖥️ Environment

- OS: Linux
- Desktop Environment: XFCE (X11)
- GPU: Intel Integrated Graphics
- Browser: Google Chrome (Stable)
- Language: Korean locale (Desktop folder = `바탕화면`)

---

## ❗ Original Problem

- Chrome streaming freezes (scroll/click unresponsive)
- Fixed when launched via terminal with custom flags
- ❌ Desktop icon launch ignored those flags
- Result:
  - Streaming freezes returned
  - Different runtime behavior between terminal vs icon

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

1. XFCE **does not automatically apply terminal launch options** to desktop icons
2. `.desktop` files are sensitive to:
   - Line breaks in `Exec=`
   - Incorrect binary paths
   - Missing execution permissions
3. XFCE desktop icons require:
   - Correct Desktop directory (`xdg-user-dir DESKTOP`)
   - Explicit user approval (“Allow Launching”)

---

## 🎯 Final Working Strategy

> **Make the desktop icon run exactly the same command as the terminal.**

Key points:
- Use a **single-line `Exec=`**
- Use the **absolute Chrome binary path**
- Place the file in the **correct desktop directory**
- Reload XFCE desktop

---

## 📁 Confirm Desktop Directory

```bash
xdg-user-dir DESKTOP

Output (example):
/home/donghan/바탕화면
This confirms the real desktop folder used by XFCE.

📄 Final Working .desktop File
File name
google-chrome-stable-safe.desktop
Location
~/바탕화면/google-chrome-stable-safe.desktop

[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=Google Chrome (Safe Streaming)
Comment=Stable Chrome for XFCE + Intel iGPU (No UI Freeze)
Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome --disable-accelerated-2d-canvas --disable-gpu-compositing --disable-features=UseSkiaRenderer --ozone-platform=x11 %U
Icon=google-chrome
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Network;WebBrowser;
StartupNotify=true

⚠️ Important:
    • Exec= must be a single line
    • Do NOT use \ line continuation
    • Do NOT wrap the command in quotes

🔐 Required Permissions
chmod +x ~/바탕화면/google-chrome-stable-safe.desktop
Reload the XFCE desktop:
xfdesktop --reload

🖱️ Mandatory GUI Step (XFCE Security)
After the icon appears:
    1. Right-click the icon
    2. Select “Allow Launching”
    3. Double-click to run
Without this step, the icon may not execute correctly.

✅ Verification
Launch Chrome using the desktop icon, then open:
chrome://gpu
Expected stable state:
    • Canvas: Software only
    • Rasterization: Software only
    • Video Decode: Hardware accelerated
    • Vulkan: Disabled
    • Streaming works without UI freeze

🧠 Key Lessons
    • XFCE desktop icons are not the same as menu entries
    • Terminal success ≠ desktop icon success
    • .desktop files must be precise and minimal
    • Absolute paths + single-line Exec are critical

📌 Final Result
    • ✅ Desktop icon launches Chrome with stable flags
    • ✅ Same behavior as terminal execution
    • ✅ Streaming works without freezes
    • ✅ Persists across reboots
