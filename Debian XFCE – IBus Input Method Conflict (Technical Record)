# Debian XFCE – IBus Input Method Conflict (Technical Record)

This document records a **real input method conflict issue** encountered on  
**Debian with the XFCE desktop environment**, involving **IBus**.

The issue was reproducible, persistent, and resolved only after **complete removal of IBus**.

---

## System Environment

- OS: Debian (stable)
- Desktop Environment: XFCE (X11 session)
- Input Method Framework: IBus (default Debian package)
- Keyboard: Korean (Hangul) physical keyboard

---

## Problem Summary

On Debian XFCE, **IBus caused a persistent conflict with keyboard input handling**, resulting in:

- ❌ Hangul (한/영) key not working
- ❌ Hangul key ignored entirely by IBus
- ✅ Only `Shift + Space` toggled Korean/English
- ❌ No GUI option to remap Hangul key
- ❌ IBus restart failures
- ❌ Missing configuration options in `ibus-setup`

This behavior was **not user misconfiguration**, but a structural issue.

---

## Observed Symptoms

### 1. Hangul Key Ignored
- Pressing the physical **Hangul key** had no effect
- Key events were not recognized by IBus

### 2. Limited Input Toggle
- Only `Shift + Space` worked for language switching
- This behavior is hardcoded fallback behavior in IBus

### 3. Missing GUI Configuration
Running:
```bash
ibus-setup
