# ✅ Enable Num Lock from Login Screen (FINAL – SINGLE BLOCK)
# Debian / XFCE / LightDM

## Background
On Debian systems using XFCE with LightDM, Num Lock is often disabled at the
login screen. This causes inconvenience when entering passwords using the
numeric keypad.

This document records the FINAL and VERIFIED solution that enables Num Lock
starting from the login screen, before any user session begins.

---

## Environment
- OS: Debian
- Desktop Environment: XFCE
- Display Manager: LightDM
- Display Server: X11

---

## Step 1: Install numlockx

sudo apt update
sudo apt install numlockx -y

numlockx is a lightweight utility used to control the Num Lock state under X11.

---

## Step 2: Configure LightDM (Login Screen Level)

Open or create the LightDM configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

Add the following content EXACTLY as shown:

[Seat:*]
greeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/numlockx on

Explanation:
- greeter-setup-script runs BEFORE the login screen is displayed
- numlockx on enables Num Lock at the greeter level
- This affects the login screen itself, not just the user session

Save and exit:
- Ctrl + O → Enter
- Ctrl + X

---

## Step 3: Reboot

reboot

---

## Verification

After reboot:
- Wait for the LightDM login screen
- Check the Num Lock LED
- Use the numeric keypad immediately

Expected result:
- Num Lock is ON at the login screen
- Numeric keypad works before login

---

## Final Verdict

For Debian + XFCE users, enabling Num Lock via LightDM with numlockx
is the MOST reliable, practical, and stable solution.

Once applied, Num Lock works from the login screen onward,
eliminating the need for session scripts or manual toggling.
