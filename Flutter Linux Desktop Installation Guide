# Flutter Linux Desktop Installation Guide

This document explains how to install **Flutter** and enable **Linux desktop app development** on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- OS: Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint (64-bit)
- Shell: bash
- Internet connection
- Git installed

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git curl
2. Download Flutter SDK
Move to your home directory and clone the Flutter SDK (stable channel).

bash
코드 복사
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
Flutter will be installed at:

bash
코드 복사
~/flutter
3. Add Flutter to PATH
Add Flutter to your PATH so the flutter command works globally.

bash
코드 복사
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
Verify installation:

bash
코드 복사
flutter --version
Expected output example:

nginx
코드 복사
Flutter 3.x.x • channel stable • https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
4. Install Linux Desktop Dependencies
Install required packages for building Flutter Linux desktop apps.

bash
코드 복사
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config \
  libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev
5. Run Flutter Diagnostics
Check Flutter environment status.

bash
코드 복사
flutter doctor
Follow any instructions shown if issues are reported.

6. Enable Linux Desktop Support
Enable Linux desktop development explicitly.

bash
코드 복사
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
Run detailed diagnostics:

bash
코드 복사
flutter doctor -v
Expected status:

css
코드 복사
[✓] Flutter
[✓] Linux toolchain - develop for Linux desktop
7. Run Demo App (Installation Test)
Create and run a demo Flutter desktop application.

bash
코드 복사
flutter create flutter_demo
cd flutter_demo
flutter run -d linux
Expected result:

A GUI window opens

A counter with a "+" button is displayed

Clicking the button increases the number

8. Verify Linux Device Detection
bash
코드 복사
flutter devices
Expected output:

scss
코드 복사
Linux (desktop) • linux • linux-x64 • Linux
9. Troubleshooting
flutter: command not found
Ensure PATH is correctly set in ~/.bashrc

Run source ~/.bashrc again

Linux toolchain errors
Confirm libgtk-3-dev is installed

Re-run flutter doctor

10. Next Steps
Build Flutter-based Linux GUI applications

Wrap existing Python or C tools with Flutter UI

Package apps as .deb files for distribution
