# 🔊 Audio Fix: Dummy Output Issue (XFCE + PulseAudio)

## Summary

This document records the **successful resolution of a “no sound / Dummy Output” issue**
that occurred after launching Google Chrome with custom GPU flags on **XFCE**.

The problem was **not Chrome itself**, but an **audio backend fallback to Dummy Output**
caused by PulseAudio losing track of the real sound device.

---

## 🖥️ Environment

- OS: Linux
- Desktop Environment: XFCE (X11)
- Browser: Google Chrome (custom launch flags)
- Audio Backend: **PulseAudio (standalone)**
- PipeWire / WirePlumber: ❌ Not installed
- Hardware: Intel integrated audio

---

## ❗ Symptoms

- YouTube / Chrome video plays normally
- ❌ No sound at all
- Volume sliders move but no audio output
- In **Volume Control → Output Devices**, only:
Dummy Output

is shown
- Chrome shows multiple playback streams, but all are silent

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

- Chrome was launched with custom GPU/X11 flags
- PulseAudio failed to re-bind to the real ALSA sound device
- PulseAudio fell back to **Dummy Output**
- Result:
- Video works
- Audio pipeline is disconnected

This is a **known and common issue** on XFCE + PulseAudio setups.

---

## ✅ Confirmed Audio Backend

Attempting to restart WirePlumber failed:

```bash
systemctl --user restart wireplumber
Result:

Unit wireplumber.service not found
➡ This confirms the system uses PulseAudio only, not PipeWire.

🛠️ Final Working Solution (PulseAudio)
1️⃣ Fully restart PulseAudio (safe)
bash
코드 복사
pulseaudio -k
sleep 2
pulseaudio --start
This does NOT log out or kill the X session

It forces PulseAudio to re-detect ALSA devices

2️⃣ Verify PulseAudio is running
bash
코드 복사
pactl info
Expected output contains:

pgsql
코드 복사
Server Name: pulseaudio
3️⃣ Reopen Volume Control
Open Volume Control and go to:

Output Devices
✅ Expected result:

Dummy Output disappears

One or more real devices appear, such as:

Built-in Audio Analog Stereo

Speaker / Headphones

HDA Intel PCH

Select the real analog output.

4️⃣ Restart media playback
Pause YouTube / Chrome video

Wait 2–3 seconds

Play again ▶

Sound should now be restored.

❌ If Dummy Output Still Appears
Check ALSA device detection
bash
코드 복사
aplay -l
Expected example:

yaml
코드 복사
card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALCxxx Analog
If no devices are listed, the issue is at the kernel/ALSA level.

Force ALSA reload (if needed)
bash
코드 복사
sudo alsa force-reload
Then restart PulseAudio again:

bash
코드 복사
pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start
🧠 Key Lessons
Chrome audio issues can be audio-backend problems, not browser bugs

Dummy Output means no real sound card is bound

PulseAudio may silently fall back after GPU / X11 changes

Restarting PulseAudio is often sufficient

✅ Final Result
✔ Dummy Output removed

✔ Real audio device restored

✔ Chrome / YouTube sound working normally

✔ No system reboot required
