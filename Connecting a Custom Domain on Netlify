# Connecting a Custom Domain on Netlify (Example: md.com)

This guide explains how to connect your Netlify site  
(currently: `https://jb-bank-philippines.netlify.app`)  
to your own domain (example: `md.com`).

The **recommended and safest method** is using **Netlify DNS (nameserver change)**.

---

## 0) Prerequisites
- Your site is already deployed on Netlify (Published)
- You already own the domain `md.com`
- You want to avoid DNS conflicts (A/CNAME issues)

---

## 1) Add the Custom Domain in Netlify

1. Log in to **Netlify**
2. Select your site
3. Go to **Site settings**
4. Open **Domain management**
5. Click **Add custom domain**
6. Enter: `md.com`
7. Click **Verify** → **Add domain**

### (Recommended) Also add `www.md.com`
- Add `www.md.com` the same way
- This allows easy redirection between `www` and non-`www`

---

## 2) Switch to Netlify DNS (Recommended)

### 2-1) Enable Netlify DNS
1. In **Site settings → Domain management**
2. Find your domain `md.com`
3. Choose **Use Netlify DNS** (wording may vary)
4. Netlify will show **4 nameservers (NS)**

Example format:
dns1.pXX.nsone.net
dns2.pXX.nsone.net
dns3.pXX.nsone.net
dns4.pXX.nsone.net

> IMPORTANT: Copy **exactly** the nameservers shown in Netlify.

---

## 3) Change Nameservers at Your Domain Provider

⚠️ Do **NOT** edit A records or CNAME records here.  
You must change **nameservers**, not DNS records.

1. Log in to your domain registrar (Gabia, Whois, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Open domain management for `md.com`
3. Find **Nameserver / Name Servers / NS settings**
4. Replace existing nameservers with the **4 Netlify nameservers**
5. Save / Apply changes

---

## 4) Wait for DNS Propagation
- Usually **10 minutes to 1 hour**
- In some cases up to **24 hours**
- During this time:
  - The domain may not load (normal)
  - HTTPS may not work yet (normal)

🚫 Do not change anything while waiting.

---

## 5) HTTPS (SSL) – Automatic
- Netlify automatically issues a **free SSL certificate**
- Go to:
  **Site settings → Domain management → HTTPS**
- HTTPS is enabled once DNS propagation completes

Access:
https://md.com

## 6) Final Check

### Basic access
- `http://md.com`
- `https://md.com`

### If www was added
- `https://www.md.com`

### Content paths
- `https://md.com/news/`
- `https://md.com/news/korea-accepts-80000-e9/`

---

## 7) (Recommended) Set Primary Domain
In **Domain management**:
- Choose either `md.com` or `www.md.com` as **Primary domain**
- Enable automatic redirect for the other

Recommended:
- Primary: `md.com`
- Redirect: `www.md.com` → `md.com`

---

## 8) Manual A Record / CNAME Method (Not Recommended)
Only for reference. This method is error-prone.

Typical records:
A @ 75.2.60.5
A @ 99.83.190.102
CNAME www jb-bank-philippines.netlify.app

⚠️ Risks:
- Easy to misconfigure
- www / non-www conflicts
- Manual maintenance required

Netlify DNS is strongly preferred.

---

## 9) Common Problems

### Domain does not load
- DNS propagation still in progress
- Nameservers not changed (A/CNAME edited instead)
- Domain added in Netlify but DNS not updated at registrar

### `/news/` shows 404
- `news/` folder not deployed
- Wrong publish directory

Check:
- **Site settings → Build & deploy → Build settings**
- Publish directory should usually be `.` (root)

---

## 10) Practical Operating Model
- **SNS**: daily, fast, short posts
- **Website**: archive important notices and policy updates
- **/news/**: bulletin-board style index
- **Domain**: your permanent personal identity anchor
