# Debian + XFCE System Finalization Report  
*(Input Method, Performance, Power Management – Final State)*

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document records the **final, stabilized state** of a Debian + XFCE system after:

- Resolving input method conflicts
- Optimizing system performance
- Verifying resource efficiency
- Confirming power management behavior

This is an **end-of-setup record**, not a work-in-progress note.

---

## 2. System Environment (Final)

- OS: Debian (stable)
- Desktop Environment: XFCE (X11)
- Input Method: **fcitx5 (single framework)**
- Browser: Google Chrome
- RAM: ~8 GB
- Power Management: XFCE + kernel + TLP
- Status: **Stable / Optimized / Verified**

---

## 3. Input Method Resolution (Completed)

### Problem (Past)
- IBus caused structural conflicts on XFCE
- Hangul key not recognized
- Shift+Space fallback only
- Missing configuration options (Debian IBus packaging)

### Resolution (Final)
- IBus completely removed
- fcitx5 installed as the **only input framework**
- Environment variables correctly set:
  ```text
  GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
  QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx
  XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx
fcitx5 runs as a single daemon with:

CPU usage: ~0%

Memory usage: ~40 MB

✅ Input is now stable, predictable, and conflict-free.

4. Performance Verification
CPU
Idle usage: ~3–5%

No background spikes

Desktop overhead negligible

Memory
Total usage (desktop + Chrome): ~1.5 GB

Swap usage: 0%

Interpretation
XFCE introduces very low system overhead

Most resource usage comes from applications (Chrome), not the desktop

System remains responsive under normal workload

5. Desktop Efficiency (XFCE)
XFCE proves to be:

Lightweight

Predictable

Minimal in background services

Free from unnecessary daemons or indexing

Compared to heavier desktops, XFCE maximizes usable resources for applications.

6. Power Management Status (Final)
Current State
XFCE power manager active

Kernel CPU frequency scaling active

TLP installed and enabled

Suspend / screen blanking / idle handling functional

Characteristics
Power management works correctly

Behavior is conservative and stable

No aggressive or unpredictable power scaling

Important Note
Unlike Windows, Linux power management is modular by design.
This system is now configured to the recommended optimal state for XFCE.

✅ No further tuning required for normal use.

7. Stability Assessment
Area	Status
Input method	Stable
Desktop performance	Efficient
Resource usage	Low
Power management	Functional
Background conflicts	None
User intervention needed	No

8. Final Evaluation
The system is complete and properly configured.

All known structural issues resolved

No conflicting components remain

Performance and power usage verified

Suitable for long-term daily use

This setup represents a clean, efficient, and maintainable Debian XFCE system.

9. End of Configuration
No further installation or tuning is required.

Any future changes should be intentional, not corrective.

This document marks the end of the setup process.
